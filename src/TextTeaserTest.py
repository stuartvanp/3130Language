Let's be clear, people on Permanent Disability are expected to survive on half of what CERB is monthly. The billionaire class sure wants all those minimum wage earners back on the job fast, you know, the ones making the billionaires all that money... and especially before those workers get used to making more money collecting CERB than they do in their minimum wage (essential) job. Right on schedule. Right-wing suggests without evidence that people won't work because of CERB. Wealthy shareholders opposed to a $15 min wage think workers should be working to make them more dividends, even if some of you will contract Covid19 & die in the service of greed. The $2000/month CERB highlights the cruelty of our provincial social assistance and disability systems, which expect recipients to live on far less on a permanent basis, and jump through far greater hoops to receive the funds. The level of brain worms to think that CERB is 'getting paid to not work' instead of 'receiving money to not die'. Y’all are sooo stupid for buying designer with your CERB cheques. CERB provides the perfect template for a guaranteed minimum wage, something that more and more people are warming up to thanks to CERB, and that is having the Financial Post collectively lose their shit apparently. When are you, all MPPs, medical officers, and government staff going to give up your full salary and go on CERB ($1200/month) like the rest of us peasants in Ontario. All of you should earn $1200 a month until you open up the province. Enjoy the hurt that we do. After weeks of confusion for vulnerable people seeking support, the province has decided to deduct CERB income from ODSP & OW recipients. The scheme lets the province make money off the backs of recipients during the pandemic. Just make the CERB universal. As the NDP has been saying for over a month now. Emergency Student Benefit gets a failing grade - just make the CERB universal. The free meals for healthcare workers is such a kind sentiment, but if the infrastructure plus capacity is there, it would be amazing for these efforts to be directed to folks who aren’t generating an income during the pandemic, with children/family to feed/look after, all on CERB. Why are students not receiving the same amount on CERB? As a longtime post-secondary educator, many students often had families, bills & rent! Students need real help now & should not be treated as less deserving of the same assistance.The system needs to shift to support equity! A lot of vulnerable people are waiting to get helped such as pregnant women who are not qualified for cerb or ei and were working got lay offs from jobs. I know a lot of ppl who are spending their cerb money in non essential shoppings and on one side ppl r struggling to live. I received an email about a thriving business whose workers quit to go on CERB - it’s fraud, but it’s happening, and more must be done to ensure benefits go to those in need, not to those who just want to take the summer off. Living with Covid 19 has been incredibly difficult because the federal government has failed to deliver the CERB to eligible Canadians. Evidently they are completely uninterested in fixing the problem. Canadians deserve a government that treats us fairly, not this trainwreck. Foreign students cannot apply for CESB. Full stop. Like all qualifying workers, international students who earned > $5,000 over 12 months can apply for the CERB if they lost their jobs because of COVID-19. The CERB is not a student benefit")
